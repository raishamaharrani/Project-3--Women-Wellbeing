# Executive Summary
This project aims to develop a comprehensive Global Women's Professional Well-Being Index using key datasets that reflect various aspects of women's professional well-being across countries. The index will provide valuable insights into women's professional well-being in countries and globally.

# Project Description
The project aims to provide insight on the professional development of women globally by using a collection of economic and social indicators for various entities, with each row representing a single entity. The columns represent different variables, including codes, years, and various metrics such as average hours worked, employment population ratio, gender wage gap, labor force, GDP per capita, school years, paid leave, agriculture, industry, and female share of employment in services.
